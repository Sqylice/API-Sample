# EmployeeAPI

This is a basic app that reads from:
http://dummy.restapiexample.com/api/v1/employees

Then returns an ordered list of cards with everyone's name, age and salary.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnsoncodehk.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnsoncodehk.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Compile and Minify for Production

IMPORTANT! I chose to make this for the latest version of Vue 3. This has worked well overall but a known issue is that you will need to use specifically this command in order to make it work on all browsers.

```sh
npm run build
```
